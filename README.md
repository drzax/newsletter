# newsletter

*Civic Tech Monthy* is a email newsletter produced by the [OpenAustralia Foundation](oaf.org.au) **for people who are interested in development of technology that empowers people to change their society**. The jobs that this newsletter should do for these people include:

* provide examples of how technology is being to enable civic change, that they weren't previously aware of
* connect them to other people interested in the things that they are interested in
* reassure them of the positive impact these projects can have
* give them interesting things to read
* provide them with projects that they can use themselves
* let them know about events they can go to

The newsletter is sent out the Thursday before the [OpenAustralia Foundation meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/), which is usually held on the last Tuesday of the month.

## Principles

These are the principles that guide the development and editorial direction of this project:

* People are smart *and* busy
* Humans respond to humans, so have fun
* Knowledge and inspiration provide leverage for action
