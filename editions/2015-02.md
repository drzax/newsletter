Hi there,

Welcome to the first edition of Civic Tech Monthly *breaks champaign bottle*.

Today we set sail for interesting projects, people and ideas around the development of technology that empowers people to change their society.

This voyage is an experiment, we're in uncharted waters, so please get involved. Let us know if the links are interesting and what you think about them (better yet let everyone know on twitter). Don't hold back if you think we're sailing off course, if you want moreâ€”or less links, etc. .

You can also [contribute to the newsletter on GitHub](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter), like all our projects.

If you think this is interesting you're sure to have friends who would too. Please pass on [the subscribe link]() and make noise via the social media tubes.

Without further ado:

## Links for your weekend
