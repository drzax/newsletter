### [3 ways to keep They Vote For You tickety boo](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/01/30/3-ways-to-keep-they-vote-for-you-tickety-boo/)

For the past 18 months [Micaela Ash](https://twitter.com/M_M_Norah) has done an amazing job building up the division summaries and policies on our latest project [They Vote For You](http://www.theyvoteforyou.org.au/)—it is a vast new resource of how our laws are made. Micaela has now moved on to new, exciting work, so she left us some parting instructions on how we can keep the resource in shape. Surely there are people on this list who could take a few minutes to summarise a division once every few weeks?

### [Percs: searchable pecuniary interest disclosures](http://percs.otherchirps.net/?query=development)

Following January’s #nswvotes meetup, [Chris Nilsson]() whipped up a way to search the text of the previous very inaccessible 2013-2014 NSW Legislative Assembly Pecuniary Interest Disclosures. A huge step forward in the accessibility of this information, and there is more in the works—see [the OAF Meetup’s discussion board](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/messages/boards/thread/48640454).


### [Nick Evershed injects some context into the news](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/feb/14/tony-abbott-is-not-alone-in-using-the-word-holocaust-to-score-political-points)

After Tony Abbott apologised for saying Labor created a “holocaust” in defence industry jobs, [Nick Evershed](https://twitter.com/nickevershed) used the [OpenAustralia API](http://www.openaustralia.org.au/api/) to provide more context about the use of the term in Parliament.


### [Hackfarming Blood Buddies](https://adactio.com/journal/8352)

[Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/) takes us through the process of planning, building and deploying a hack to help more people donate blood at [Clearleft’s](http://clearleft.com/) Hackfarm getaway this year.

Their 2012 Hackfarm resulted in a prototype for [a personal political opinion tracker](http://hackfarm.org/product)—a few people at the [OpenAustralia Foundation meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/) have suggested similar concepts for projects they want to work on.


### [Local events for Internation Open Data Day](http://au.okfn.org/2015/02/10/australian-activities-on-international-open-data-day-21-february/)

This Saturday, 21st Feb, is [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/). The Open Knowledge Foundation Australia have done a wrap-up of events, including a day long workshopping session hosted by [Code for Australia](http://www.codeforaustralia.org/) in [Sydney tomorrow](http://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/international-open-data-day-sydney-tickets-15462067460). It is a free event and registrations are still open if you can make it.


### [Learning to contribute with Git](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/)

Contributing through the Git version control system is an important skill for people working on civic tech and open source generally—but it ain't that easy to learn and it's not always clear where to start. We've observed that it can be a barrier to people getting involved.

Aside from the link above there are many tutorials and articles to help. Luke found the [Web Ahead Podcast's Git episode](http://thewebahead.net/40) very helpful. Github also have a whole [list of resources](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/). Sometimes the best thing todo is ask someone to sit down and take you through it.


### [12 steps toward a better neighbourhood](http://www.onbeing.org/program/feature/12-steps-toward-better-neighborhood/4723)
Henare and Luke visited the [Friends of Erskineville](http://www.erskinevillevillage.org/) community group in Sydney last week. They introduced the group to [PlanningAlerts](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/) and had a great time finding out about how they’re working to impact their area. They picked up this list of *12 steps* that they were discussing. These are practical ideas for organising for civic change in a local community. They could give direction for people interested in civi tech to get involved and suggest activities to design/build supporting tools and infrastructure for. 


### [Civic Hall launched in NYC](http://civichall.org/a-new-home-for-civic-technology/)
