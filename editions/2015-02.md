### [Percs: searchable pecuniary interest disclosures]((http://percs.otherchirps.net/?query=development))

Following January’s #nswvotes meetup, [Chris Nilsson]() whipped up a way to search the text of the previous very inaccessible 2013-2014 NSW Legislative Assembly Pecuniary Interest Disclosures. A huge step forward in the accessibility of this information, and there is more in the works—see [the OAF Meetup’s discussion board](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/messages/boards/thread/48640454).

### [Civic Hall launched in NYC](http://civichall.org/a-new-home-for-civic-technology/)
