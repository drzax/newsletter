## News & Notes

### [Update on the fate of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner](http://foi-privacy.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/ag-brandis-not-for-turning-on-bid-to.html)

Peter Timmins has published an update on whether or not the OAIC, the independent Federal office overseeing Freedom of Information, Privacy and information policy, will be abolished. This follows discussions at Senate Estimates in late February.


### [New inequality data by location on KnowYourPlace](http://blogs.crikey.com.au/croakey/2015/03/09/the-brave-new-world-of-open-data/)

Rosie Williams reflects on World Open Data Day and announces the new inequality data on [KnowYourPlace](http://infoaus.net/seifa/index.php) in the always interesting [Croaky Heath Blog](http://blogs.crikey.com.au/croakey/).
Rosie spoke about working on this project in [our interview](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/02/19/rosie-williams-interview/) last month.


### [Quickly find video of speeches in Parliament](https://twitter.com/henaredegan/status/575453041505136640)

Some exciting news from the Federal Parliamentary website.
You can now quickly find the video footage for speeches in Federal Parliament.
Hansard now has a link to ‘Watch ParlView Video’ next to each transcript.
It appears that only speeches since the start of 2014 have this feature so far. Wouldn't it wonderful to have this on [OpenAustralia.org.au](http://www.openaustralia.org.au/) as well?


### [A local *They Vote For You* for Redlands, QLD](http://redlands2030.net/?p=7633)

Residents of Redlands, Queensland are pushing for greater transparency in local council voting.
[Redlands 2030](http://redlands2030.net/), a community group publishing civic information and news for Redland locals, present a case for open local democracy and explain their council’s current position.
They collated [all the votes of the current councillors](http://redlands2030.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RCC-Voting-Table-May-2012%E2%80%94December-2014_v1.xlsx) and are now looking for help to publish them in a more accessible form.


### [Help open the NSW register of MP interests](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2015/mar/09/help-us-investigate-the-register-of-interests-political-gifts-and-investments-in-nsw)

You can help us all learn about the interests of NSW MPs—their  income, investments, properties, gifts and more.
Nick Evershed and  Todd Moore have set up a page on the Guardian where you can easily help turn images of register of interest forms into accessible structured data.
The 2014 register is about 70% complete—go help finish it off.
This is another exciting development following January’s #nswvotes meetup!


### [Sobanukirwa launched in Rwanda](https://sobanukirwarwanda.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/welcome-to-sobanukirwa-an-access-to-information-website-for-rwanda/)

Rwandans can now request government information through [Sobanukirwa](https://sobanukirwa.rw/).
This is the 19th international deployment of [Alaveteli](http://alaveteli.org/), the software also running Australia’s [Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/).
There’s one partially successfully request so far, for the [“Health care location details for facilities in Rwanda”](https://sobanukirwa.rw/request/health_care_location_details_for).


### [UK Parliament Digital Democracy report](http://www.digitaldemocracy.parliament.uk/chapter/summary#main-content)

The UK Parliament’s Digital Democracy Commission released *Open up!*, a report into how “Parliament could use digital technology to work more effectively and in a way that people expect in the modern world”.
The presentation of the report is a device agnostic website with lots of video and illustration.
Check out the opening [Key targets and recommendations](http://www.digitaldemocracy.parliament.uk/chapter/summary).


### [Changes to our PlanningAlerts API](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter/issues/41)

We’re introducing API keys for all users of the [PlanningAlerts API](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/api/howto).
From the 1st of June 2015 it will become mandatory to use an API key.
Never fear, it's easy to get started.
[The blog post](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/03/02/planningalerts-api-changes/) contains the instructions you need.


### [Scrape javascript heavy sites using morph.io](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/03/17/scraping-javascript-sites-with-morph-io/)

We came up against some tricky anti-scraping technology this month (which is additionally a big accessibility problem).
To overcome these blockers we added [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) support to [Morph.io](https://morph.io).
Now everyone can scrape javascript heavy sites, and get more structured data from the web.
Go forth and scrape!


### [The Poplus Component Integration toolkit](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/poplus/NEpLV_omCaI/VlqbSG-f9SAJ)

[Associazione Openpolis](http://www.openpolis.it/) (Italy) have launched an early version of [*Poplus Component Integration Toolkit*](https://github.com/openpolis/poplus-pci) to help python developers mash up data from different Poplus components.
The project [received a Poplus Grant in 2014](http://poplus.org/posts/poplus-proposals-outcome/).
