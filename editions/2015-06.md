Welcome to the fifth edition of Civic Tech Monthly. Below you’ll find news and notes about civic tech from Australia and around the world.

We have a slightly smaller number of news items this month. So it's a great time to remind you that the entire production of Civic Tech Monthly is done [in the open on GitHub](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter). We very much welcome suggestions throughout the month for items to add to the newsletter.

If you'd like to share the sign up link it's [http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX](http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX). Sydneysiders, we hope to see you at the [Pub Meet on Tuesday](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/222169509/).

## News and Notes

### Scraping get-togethers galore

For the last couple of months Luke Bacon and Matthew Landauer have been working hard on polishing our scraping platform, [morph.io](https://morph.io/). This has handily coincided with a number of Sydney events to do with scraping, organised by us and others.

If you're **in Sydney tonight**, Thursday the 25th of June, head along to [Australia Open Data's event](http://www.meetup.com/Australia-Open-Data/events/223296955/) organised by Rosie Williams of InfoAus fame. About a fortnight ago Luke organised a low key event dedicated to scraping that was [a great success](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/12/a-little-scraping-goes-a-long-way/). We also had a great time scraping with Googlers last week that increased or restored PlanningAlerts coverage to more than 2 million Australians - there'll be more about this big development in a forthcoming blog post.

### [Helping people open governments around the world – AlaveteliCon 2015](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/02/helping-people-open-governments-around-the-world-alavetelicon-2015/)

Last month [#Alaveteli15](https://www.mysociety.org/projects/freedom-of-information/alaveteli/alavetelicon%202015/) had top billing in this newsletter. This month you can read all about Henare Degan's experience at the conference in [his blog post](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/02/helping-people-open-governments-around-the-world-alavetelicon-2015/) summing up the two huge days he had at the conference. From sharing war stories of peoples' experiences using Freedom of Information with [Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/) in Australia, through to hatching international plans to develop a guide to what makes a good FOI law in today's online world.

### [s115a.com](https://s115a.com/)

Australia's Parliament [recently voted](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/divisions/senate/2015-06-22/4) to enact legislation which allows copyright holders (like movie, TV and music producers) to apply to the Federal Court to have piracy-related websites blocked. Will Ockenden created [s115a.com](https://s115a.com/) (named after the section of the law that was added) in an attempt to introduce some transparency to those site-blocking laws by letting you know when an application is made, and (hopefully) the final result.

### [18F launches new US openFOIA site](https://open.foia.gov/)

[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) is the US Government's digital services delivery team, similar to the well known and regarded [GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) in the UK (that the Australian Government is hoping to repeat with the [DTO](https://www.dto.gov.au/)). They have just launched [openFOIA](https://open.foia.gov/), which guides citizens through the process of making a Freedom of Information request. It's interesting to see a government-delivered take on this (and heartening that they at least acknowledge this has [been done before](https://github.com/18F/foia-hub#how-is-this-different-from-other-stuff)). It's being [developed in the open](https://github.com/18F/foia-hub) on GitHub, like everything else 18F do.

### [A step forward for open government in NSW and the NT](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/11/a-step-forward-for-open-government-in-nsw-and-the-nt/)

Anyone can now easily make requests for information from New South Wales and the Northern Territory governments and local councils using [Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/). We've added hundreds of new authorities to the site and made a host of changes to facilitate some of the quirks in the different access to information laws. We're really pleased to see some authorities already helping citizens access information important to them. You can read more of the nitty-gritty in [our blog post announcing the launch](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/11/a-step-forward-for-open-government-in-nsw-and-the-nt/).

### Civic tech job opportunities

It's not often these come up so we're excited to hear about two sets of job opportunities this month. [Code for Australia](http://www.codeforaustralia.org/) is [hiring fellows](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuxPwNIAIdvZkDAMIXNQbkwzCY6uRsh-LmaYCoeJNz4/mobilebasic?pli=1) - they're looking for developers, designers or community organisers to work at the NSW Department of Family and Community Services and the Victorian Neighbourhood Justice Centre. Applications are also open for the next cohort of [Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellows](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/apply/), they're after developers, technologists, civic hackers, or data crunchers who want to help change the world of journalism.

### [The next 3 months are going to be really busy – here is our plan](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/25/the-next-3-months-are-going-to-be-really-busy-here-is-our-plan/)

Since the beginning of this year the core team at the OpenAustralia Foundation has been getting together for a day every quarter to make a plan for the upcoming 3 months. This time Matthew Landauer has written up our plans in a blog post. As you'll [see in the post](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/25/the-next-3-months-are-going-to-be-really-busy-here-is-our-plan/) we've got another very busy 3 months ahead!
