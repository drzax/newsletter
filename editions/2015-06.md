Ahoy there and welcome to the fifth edition of Civic Tech Monthly. Below youâ€™ll find news and notes about civic tech from Australia and around the world.

We have a slightly smaller bounty of news items this month. So it's a great time to remind you that the entire production of Civic Tech Monthly is done [in the open on GitHub](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter) and it's easy to submit your own news for us to include in the newsletter.

If you'd like to share the sign up link it's [http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX](http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX). Sydneysiders, we hope to see you at the [Pub Meet on Tuesday](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/222169509/).
