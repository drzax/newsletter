Ahoy there and welcome to the fifth edition of Civic Tech Monthly. Below youâ€™ll find news and notes about civic tech from Australia and around the world.

We have a slightly smaller bounty of news items this month. So it's a great time to remind you that the entire production of Civic Tech Monthly is done [in the open on GitHub](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter) and it's easy to submit your own news for us to include in the newsletter.

If you'd like to share the sign up link it's [http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX](http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX). Sydneysiders, we hope to see you at the [Pub Meet on Tuesday](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/222169509/).

## News and Notes

### Scraping get-togethers galore

For the last couple of months Luke Bacon and Matthew Landauer have been working hard on polishing our scraping platform, morph.io. This has handily coincided with a number of Sydney events to do with scraping organised by us and others. If you're **in Sydney tonight** head along to [Australia Open Data's event](http://www.meetup.com/Australia-Open-Data/events/223296955/) organised by Rosie Williams of InfoAus fame.

About a fortnight ago Luke organised a low key event dedicated to scraping that was [a great success](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/12/a-little-scraping-goes-a-long-way/). We also had a great time scraping with Googlers last week that increased or restored PlanningAlerts coverage to more than 2 million Australians - there'll be more about this big development in a forthcoming blog post.
