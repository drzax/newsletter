## News and Notes

### [\#Alaveteli15](https://twitter.com/hashtag/alaveteli15?src=hash&vertical=default&f=tweets)

¡Hola! to everyone over in Madrid for [AlaveteliCon 2015](https://www.mysociety.org/projects/freedom-of-information/alaveteli/alavetelicon%202015/).
For the rest of us, we can check out all the fun they’ve been having at *the* conference on Freedom of Information technologies with [\#alaveteli15](https://twitter.com/hashtag/alaveteli15?src=hash&vertical=default&f=tweets)
 on twitter.
There’s lots of interesting news and links—we just learnt that by [Ukrainian law FOI requests must be answered in 5 days!](https://twitter.com/alaveteli_foi/status/600653401437921280)
We’re looking forward to hearing more about what went down in the coming weeks.

### [“I find politics inaccessible”: User testing voter advice apps](http://www.flourish.org/2015/04/i-find-politics-inaccessible-user-testing-voter-advice-apps/)

Francis Irving, hacker on many great civic tech projects, takes 17 voter advice applications through some quick usability testing with a friend, in the lead up to the UK election.
This is a great one for people building civic tech to get us to think hard about making relevant and useful tools.

### [Nouabook helps citizens communicate with Moroccan MPs through video](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/poplus/XWzOrY-35fI/5opG2R2OgjgJ)

[Nouabook](http://nouabook.ma/) launched in 2014 to help citizens and Moroccan MPs communicate directly in an open forum.
[Andrew G. Mandelbaum, one of the project founders, explains](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/poplus/XWzOrY-35fI/5opG2R2OgjgJ) that many Moroccans use purely spoken language and don't read, and that MPs often favour video over text based media.
Responding to this context, the site now enables citizens can ask questions in video format.

This is another project built on the [WriteIt](http://writeit.poplus.org/) Poplus component.
It's interesting to see how the project can adapt to citizen needs in different contexts.
Hopefully these experiences can be used to improve the project for everyone.

### [Legislative openness highlighted at European and Asia Pacific meetings of Open Government Partnership](http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/85931527528/legislative-openness-highlighted-at-regional)

This month in Bali and Dublin, representatives of countries involved in the Open Government Partnership met to discuss their moves to improve access and engagement.
This [wrap up by Dan Swislow](http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/85931527528/legislative-openness-highlighted-at-regional) has lots of links to the different sessions and projects mentioned.

You can also watch sessions from the [Asia Pacific meeting](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/get-involved/asia-pacific-regional-meeting), including the [lightening talks](https://youtu.be/huem3QdCZWc?t=45m32s).
There were a few Australian's taking part in the Asia Pacific conference, but as far as we know, the [Australian Government is still considering it's involvement](http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/australia-positively-inclined-to-join.html).

### [When technology defines our citizenship](https://re-publica.de/en/session/living-electromagnetic-spectrum)

At the re:publica conference in Berlin earlier this month, [James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/) presents his art practice and research into government systems.
He argues that the very basic assumptions of our citizenship, defined here as 'the right to rights', are changing as our governing systems adapt to the network.
He says that transparency alone is not enough to empower citizens to protect their rights.

There loads of interesting [presentations to watch from re:publica](https://re-publica.de/archive/sessions), "Europe's biggest conference on internet and society".
Let us know on if you find any gems.

### [A year after Poplus was launched, the first million-user site](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/poplus/0aieK9X0iz4/z7OO7BCTFHAJ)

[YourNextMP.com](https://yournextmp.com/), a project using the [Popit](http://popit.poplus.org/) and [MapIt](http://mapit.poplus.org/) components, served over a million visitor in the lead up to the UK election.
Because the code and data are open for reuse, it was also used as a data source in at least 20 other projects, including by Google.
A huge congratulations to the [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/) team.

### [Join us at the CryptoParty in Sydney tomorrow evening](http://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/cryptoparty-sydney-registration-16721045096?aff=estw)

Giving citizens the means to protect their communications is an important part of empowering them to create the society they want.
That’s why the OpenAustralia Foundation is a co-sponsor of the [CryptoParty in Sydney tomorrow night](http://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/cryptoparty-sydney-registration-16721045096?aff=estw) hosted by Thoughtworks.
Currently it looks like all seats are taken, but join up to the waiting list if you’re interested as space is sure to open up.

### [Launch of Hong Kong's first Freedom of Information portal](https://accessinfo.hk/)

With the launch of [Accessinfo.hk](https://accessinfo.hk) people in Hong Kong can now easily make government information requests in the open. It’s powered by [Alaveteli](http://alaveteli.org/) of course, the same open source software running Australia’s [Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/).

### [Mixed Message in Australia's Budget for Open Government](http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/budget-allocates-transitional-cash-to.html)

On the one hand, the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) has been given $100 million startup funding to make the Australian government's front end a more rewarding experience for the citizen.
Going in the opposite direction, the government has again cut funding to the Office of the Information, and undermining its capacity to hold Government Agencies to account.
Freedom of Information (FOI) expert Peter Timmins describes the situation as “a step backward in the long journey towards transparent accountable government”.
