## News and Notes

### [\#Alaveteli15](https://twitter.com/hashtag/alaveteli15?src=hash&vertical=default&f=tweets)

¡Hola! to everyone over in Madrid for [AlaveteliCon 2015](https://www.mysociety.org/projects/freedom-of-information/alaveteli/alavetelicon%202015/).
For the rest of us, we can check out all the fun they’ve been having at *the* conference on Freedom of Information technologies with [\#alaveteli15](https://twitter.com/hashtag/alaveteli15?src=hash&vertical=default&f=tweets)
 on twitter.
There’s lots of interesting news and links—we just learnt that by [Ukrainian law FOI requests must be answered in 5 days!](https://twitter.com/alaveteli_foi/status/600653401437921280)
We’re looking forward to hearing more about what went down in the coming weeks.

### [Nouabook helps citizens communicate with Moroccan MPs through video](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/poplus/XWzOrY-35fI/5opG2R2OgjgJ)

[Nouabook](http://nouabook.ma/) launched in 2014 to help citizens and Moroccan MPs communicate directly in an open forum.
[Andrew G. Mandelbaum, one of the project founders, explains](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/poplus/XWzOrY-35fI/5opG2R2OgjgJ) that many Moroccans use purely spoken language and don't read, and that MPs often favour video over text based media.
Responding to this context, the site now enables citizens can ask questions in video format.

This is another project built on the [WriteIt](http://writeit.poplus.org/) Poplus component.
It's interesting to see how the project can adapt to citizen needs in different contexts.
Hopefully these experiences can be used to improve the project for everyone.

### [Legislative openness highlighted at European and Asia Pacific meetings of Open Government Partnership](http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/85931527528/legislative-openness-highlighted-at-regional)

This month in Bali and Dublin, representatives of countries involved in the Open Government Partnership met to discuss their moves to improve access and engagement.
This [wrap up by Dan Swislow](http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/85931527528/legislative-openness-highlighted-at-regional) has lots of links to the different sessions and projects mentioned.

You can also watch sessions from the [Asia Pacific meeting](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/get-involved/asia-pacific-regional-meeting), including the [lightening talks](https://youtu.be/huem3QdCZWc?t=45m32s).
There were a few Australian's taking part in the Asia Pacific conference, but as far as we know, the [Australian Government is still considering it's involvement](http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/australia-positively-inclined-to-join.html).

### [When technology defines our citizenship](https://re-publica.de/en/session/living-electromagnetic-spectrum)

At the re:publica conference in Berlin earlier this month, [James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/) presents his art practice and research into government systems.
He argues that the very basic assumptions of our citizenship, defined here as 'the right to rights', are changing as our governing systems adapt to the network.
He says that transparency alone is not enough to empower citizens to protect their rights.

There loads of interesting [presentations to watch from re:publica](https://re-publica.de/archive/sessions), "Europe's biggest conference on internet and society".
Let us know on if you find any gems.
