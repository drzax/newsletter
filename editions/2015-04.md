## News and Notes

### [The Impacts of Civic Technology Conference 2015](https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec2015/)

mySociety hosted the first international conference on research and civic tech in March. Luke from the OAF team went over to take part in the event and gave a workshop on some of the questions small developer teams have approaching research. [Luke wrote up a blog post](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/04/08/the-impacts-of-civic-technology-conference-2015/) with some of his take-aways and tells us the event was full of frank and interesting discussion. You can [watch the some of the presentations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMbWpADzhTC4YBfhIn7ujBO6ADXxVN5vv) and see the session slides at [mySociety’s page for the event](https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec2015/).

### [1000 entries to the Knight News Challenge](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/elections/entries?order=COMMENTS&direction=DESC)

The Knight News Challenge offers journalism, media and civic engagement projects a share in $3 million to realise their proposals. The latest challenge asks "How might we better inform voters and increase civic participation before, during and after elections?" Entries have closed but there are loads of interesting ideas to inspire a project of your own.

Members of the [Poplus Federation proposed a 6 country partnership](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/03/23/a-yay-for-poplus-moment-one-bid-six-countries/) to extend [YouNextMP](http://yournextmp.com/) to Guatemala, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Scotland, and Minnesota. There's also an entry in the top 45 to [create ElectionLeaflets.org International](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/elections/refinement/electionleaflets-org-international).

### [Right To Know is now in the ACT and on your phone!](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/04/13/right-to-know-is-now-in-the-act/)

This month we've been making big improvements to our Freedom of Information project, [Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/). So far you’ve only been able to request information from the Federal Government but now you’re also able to [request information from the ACT Government using Right to Know](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/04/13/right-to-know-is-now-in-the-act/). We've also made big changes to the design of the project so that it’s [much more useable from mobiles](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/04/02/a-better-right-to-know-on-your-phone/). It should be much easier to read request exchanges and even make requests no matter what device you use.

### [NSW Pecuniary Interest Register now transcribed and searchable](http://www.theguardian.com/global/datablog/ng-interactive/2015/mar/27/search-the-nsw-register-of-pecuniary-interests-to-see-what-politicians-have-declared)

It’s popped up in [every edition](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/category/civic-tech-monthly/) so far, but the efforts to improve access to NSW MP’s register of interests just keep on coming. The Guardian’s call for their readers help transcribed the register forms has been answered! Nick Evershed and Todd Moore have now published the results for download and access online. Well done and thanks to everyone who got involved in the project, particularly at our [#nswvotes meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/219652731/) where the idea emerged.

### [Fantasy Frontbench](http://www.fantasyfrontbench.com/)

An different perspective on exploring the positions and backgrounds of MPs developed in the lead up to the UK election. Fantasy Frontbench uses data from [They Work For You](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) and [Public Whip](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/) (equivalent of [They Vote For You](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/) in Australia).

### [Free lesson plans for civic tech and citizenship in schools](https://www.mysociety.org/lesson-plans/)

The UK’s Citizenship Foundation and mySociety have twelve lesson plans for you, including interactive activities, worksheets and background materials. The lessons aim to explain why and how students should take an active role in democracy, and how they can use civic tech tools as one way to get involved.
