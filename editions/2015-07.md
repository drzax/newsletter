Welcome to the sixth edition of Civic Tech Monthly. Below you’ll find news and notes about civic tech from Australia and around the world.

It’s been very cold here in Sydney. People were even [snowboarding](https://twitter.com/bluntshovels/status/621809775995543552) down the main street of Katoomba, where our co-founders live!

Maybe that means people have been hibernating because this month we started with slim pickings for the newsletter. Fortunately we've managed to pull together some interesting links to share with you nonetheless. Remember, if you'd like to submit your own links you can do so right on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter) where we organise this newsletter.

Folks coming to the Sydney Pub Meet on Tuesday are in for a treat this month. Anyone can give a lightning talk to share something interesting in civic tech they've seen or done. This means we've also got a lovely new venue - the Trinity Bar in Surry Hills. We've also got more room so there's still spots available for you to [RSVP and come along](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/222169513/).

## News and Notes

### Citizens vs Customers: Democracy in the age of Google (TODO: add link)

Check out the video of the Google Tech Talk that Matthew Landauer gave prior to the Google Serve event we mentioned in [last month's edition](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/06/26/civic-tech-monthly-june-2015/). You can also read more about what we achieved with a little scraping and the help of some civic-minded Googlers in Luke Bacon's blog post, "[Another 2 million people can get PlanningAlerts](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/07/03/another-2-million-people-can-get-planningalerts/)".
