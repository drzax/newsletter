# Credits

We want to get news and links from all sorts of interesting sources.

It's important to credit people and by linking to them we will anyway but this is also a cheeky way of listing good sources we can check on if we're stuck for content :simple_smile:

* [Opening Parliament blog](http://blog.openingparliament.org), especially the monthly Newsbrief
* [Peter Timmins' blog](http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com.au/)
* [Poplus list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus)
