# How to contribute

Yay! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the newsletter :bouquet:

Submit an issue with anything civic tech related and we'll look at including it in an upcoming edition of the newsletter.

In the issue provide:

* title of the resource
* url for the resource
* maximum 3 short sentences describing what it is/why it is interesting, or maybe a quote
* the author of the resource

Here's an example:

> ## [Email is your secret weapon](http://poplus.org/posts/email-is-your-secret-weapon/)
> “Sending email and doing it properly is actually surprisingly really hard and it gets even harder the more email you send.” Matthew Landauer introduces Cuttlefish, an open source transactional email server, and explains how you can apply to use a special version, hosted by the OpenAustralia Foundation, to handle email for your awesome civic tech project.  

If you feel like you need more than three short sentences to describe why your link is so important :metal: publish a blog post on it and link to that.

We use pull requests to manage the production of the newsletter so you'll be notified when it's included.

The readers of our newsletter love to hear about:

* Great civic tech projects
* Exciting features on those projects
* Important policy news that relates to civic tech, e.g. transparency or FOI related issues
* And anything else related (if you're not sure, just submit something anyway)

We're aiming for 50% of things in the newsletter to be from or about the Asia-Pacific region and half of that from Australia. We want to promote and support our local civic tech community in particular—there are other excellent newsletters that have a broad global focus.
