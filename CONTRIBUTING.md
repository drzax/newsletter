# How to contribute

Yay! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the newsletter :bouquet:

[Submit an issue](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter/issues/new?title=[ITEM]) with anything civic tech related and we'll look at including it in an upcoming edition of the newsletter.

We use pull requests to manage the production of the newsletter so you'll be notified when it's included.

The readers of our newsletter love to hear about:

* Great civic tech projects
* Exciting features on those projects
* Important policy news that relates to civic tech, e.g. transparency or FOI related issues
* And anything else related (if you're not sure, just submit something anyway)

We're aiming for 50% of things in the newsletter to be from or about the Asia-Pacific region and half of that from Australia. We want to promote and support our local civic tech community in particularâ€”there are other excellent newsletters that have a broad global focus.
