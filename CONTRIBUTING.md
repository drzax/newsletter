# How to contribute

Yay! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the newsletter :bouquet:

Submit an issue with anything civic tech related and we'll look at including it in an upcoming edition of the newsletter.

We love to hear about:

* Great civic tech projects
* Exciting features on those projects
* Important policy news that relates to civic tech, e.g. transparency or FOI related issues
* And anything else related (if you're not sure, just submit something anyway)

We're aiming for 50% of things in the newsletter to be from or about the Asia-Pacific region and half of that from Australia. We want to promote and support our local civic tech community in particular—there are other excellent newsletters that have a broad global focus.

## How we prepare an issue of the newsletter

Each month we create new a pull request on this repo that includes a Markdown file containing the content for that month’s newsletter.

The description of the pull request will mention issues that have been lodged containing stories/links for that newsletter—hopefully including some you've contributed! When the newsletter content is finalised the pull request is merged and the mentioned issues will be automagically closed by GitHub's Pull Request Magic :tm:. We then copy that content over to the [OpenAustralia Foundation blog](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/blog/) and into Mailchimp. Finally the newsletter is lovelingly delivered to the inboxes of amazing people using technology to enable civic change.
