# How to contribute

Yay! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the newsletter :bouquet:

Submit an issue with anything civic tech related and we'll look at including it in an upcoming issue (no pun intended) of the newsletter.

We love to hear about:

* Great civic tech projects
* Exciting features on those projects
* Important policy news that relates to civic tech, e.g. transparency or FOI related issues
* And anything else related (if you're not sure, just submit something anyway)

We're aiming for 50% of things in the newsletter to be about the Asia-Pacific region and 50% of that about Australia.

## How we prepare an issue of the newsletter

Each month we create a pull request on this repo that contains the newsletter for that month.

It will include a bunch of issues, i.e. stories or links (hopefully including some you've contributed!).

When the pull request is merged, i.e. it's ready to publish, those issues will be automagically closed by GitHub's Pull Request Magic :tm:
